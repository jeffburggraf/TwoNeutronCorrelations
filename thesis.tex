%% LaTeX Font encoding -- DO NOT CHANGE
\usepackage[OT1]{fontenc}

%% Babel provides support for languages.  'english' uses British
%% English hyphenation and text snippets like "Figure" and
%% "Theorem". Use the option 'ngerman' if your document is in German.
%% Use 'american' for American English.  Note that if you change this,
%% the next LaTeX run may show spurious errors.  Simply run it again.
%% If they persist, remove the .aux file and try again.
\usepackage[american]{babel}

%% Input encoding 'utf8'. In some cases you might need 'utf8x' for
%% extra symbols. Not all editors, especially on Windows, are UTF-8
%% capable, so you may want to use 'latin1' instead.
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

%% This changes default fonts for both text and math mode to use Herman Zapfs
%% excellent Palatino font.  Do not change this.

%% The AMS-LaTeX extensions for mathematical typesetting.  Do not
%% remove.
\usepackage{amsmath,amssymb,amsfonts,mathrsfs}

%% NTheorem is a reimplementation of the AMS Theorem package. This
%% will allow us to typeset theorems like examples, proofs and
%% similar.  Do not remove.
%% NOTE: Must be loaded AFTER amsmath, or the \qed placement will
%% break
\usepackage[amsmath,thmmarks]{ntheorem}

%% LaTeX' own graphics handling
\usepackage{graphicx}

%% We unfortunately need this for the Rules chapter.  Remove it

%% This allows you to add .pdf files. It is used to add the

First, I would like to thank my advisor and mentor, Dr. Dale. There tends to be an inverse relationship between the number of years of experience and the level of enthusiasm. Dr. Dale, still very excited about what he does, defies this trend. He is the most enthusiastic senior scientist I’ve had the pleasure of meeting. As a leader, he has provided for me the perfect blend of autonomy, supervision, and guidance, which has led me to achieve high levels of intellectual growth that would have been impossible otherwise. As his advisee, I never felt like a factory worker who’s purpose was to crank out data and follow orders. I was very fortunate to have been matched with an academic advisor who was the perfect fit for me.

I would also like the thank the accelerator operators of the Idaho Accelerator Center, Brian Berls, Chad O'Neill, and Kevin Folkman, for their willingness to operate the accelerator during hours extending from 8:00 AM to as late as 1:00 AM–far beyond their normal working hours.
