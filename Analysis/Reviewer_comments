Changed Fig. 4 to illustrate the differences in relative efficiency for individual detectors as a function of energy and position.

That's correct. This point wasn't mentioned in Fig. 8 because the timing is done in the analysis, not during runtime.
It is discussed in detail in the paragraph beginning on line 383 in the updated version.

Good point. Added comment about this to the caption.

Changed the wording to "minimum neutron energy cuts" when needed for clarity.

Changed wording to "...shows good agreement with the measurement for neutrons with a ToF less than 100 ns and fair agreement
for neutrons with a ToF greater than 100 ns."

The correction factors are determined from a large set of n-n events taken from many different-pulse paris.
This leads to small statistical counting errors when compared to that of the set of true n-n events taken from the same pulses,
which is the leading contributor of error in this work. If your concern is about potential systematic errors, recall that
our measurement using Cf252 agrees quite well with previous measurements. However, our measurement using Cf252 is done without
the photon beam, which may raise concerns about beam related artifacts. In this regard, note that we also measured the angular
correlations from the photo-disintegration of D2O to be the correct answer, which is simply a flat line.

This comment has motivated the addition of two plots that express the data in a different way.
They can be seen in Figs 27 and 28.
