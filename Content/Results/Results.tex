%A measurement of two-neutron opening angle distributions in the photofission of $^{238}$U
%using Bremsstrahlung photons produced via a low duty factor, pulsed LINAC, is complete.
%These results confirm the expected dependency of neutron coincidence rate on opening angle and mean neutron energy.
%Figure~\ref{fig:result} includes the coefficients from a least-squares best-fit of the data to a second order Legendre polynomial.
%These coefficients, $a_0$ and $a_2$, are a measure of the isotropic and dipole components of the opening angle distributions, respectively.
